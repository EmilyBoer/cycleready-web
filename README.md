##Helping Out
This is a project of the Code for America [San Francisco Brigade](https://github.com/sfbrigade).  Go ahead and make a fork and hack away!

We're trying to use the [git flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) conventions.  Branch your feature from `develop`, as the `master` branch is always deployable.

###Needed Areas of Expertise
* maps
* bootstrap (especially mobile-oriented)
* content writers
* artists
* bikers around SF
